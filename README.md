# [WASM with Clang](https://addiment.github.io/wasm-with-clang/)

"Hello World!" in WebAssembly with C(++) using Clang and LLD. 

**The demo will not work unless served over HTTP(s)** because WASM is blocked by [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors).

You can see the build live in your browser [here.](https://addiment.github.io/wasm-with-clang/)

The favicon in the web demo is just a recolor of the [official WebAssembly logo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/web-assembly-logo). The original is in the public domain.
